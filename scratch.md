Car analogy
 - You may not have driven an SUV, but you know how to drive
 - There are certain core bits of experience and knowledge about driving a car that you pick up and are useful whatever you drive
 - Software engineering is the same
 - What ARE those core experiences and knowledge?

That said, paradigms exist which are not always compatible (think of an 18-wheeler in the car analogy)
- Procedural
- Object-oriented
- Functional
- Reactive

**These are all muscles that need to be consistently used, or the potential for atrophy exists**

## Core skills
 - Analytical thinking
   - 5 whys
   - Keep it sharp: think through the design of something you use 
     - How did they do it?
     - How would you do it?
 - Knowing how to learn
   - Keep it sharp: learn something new as often as possible
 - Creativity
   - This might only be needed if you want to LOVE your job


## Be Pragmatic
 - Engineering is all about balance and compromise
 - Pragmatic Programmer

## Technical
 - Algorithms don't matter
   - Look for algorithm courses on Udemy
 - What Computer Science teaches is not what software engineers do
   - *Computer Engineering degrees are starting to become a thing, which is much better
 - Names, definitions and official formulations are not important, but the underlying principles are
   - Big O notation
   - etc.
 - That said, it can help to know the names of some patterns and principles to help with communication - just make sure you're able to communicate the ideas without the language
 - 

## Non-Functional Requirements
 - Code quality
 - Performance
 - Reliability
 - Monitoring
 - Security
 - 

## Have a Growth mindset
 - Grow yourself
 - Grow others (mentorship)
 - Several opportunities
   - Give a presentation on something you've learned (even a really brief thing)
   - Attend or facilitate presentations from others
   - Participate in design and code reviews (both giving and receiving, synchronous if possible)
   - Mentor someone
   - Ask someone to mentor you
 - Speak up during meetings - don't be shy!
   - It's ok to be wrong. It's ok to sound dumb from time to time. Embrace your impostor
   - Pay attention, put your ideas out there, listen to others, be obsessed with finding a better way
 - Key is to be comfortable and proficient at gaining and sharing knowledge
   - See under "Technical" - being able to communicate important technical information to others
   - If you aren't able to explain a concept to a junior engineer, you don't understand it well enough yourself
     - That's ok! Learn it together
 - Be creative!

## Attitude
- Take pride in your work
- Have a sense of ownership of your code
  - Take care of it like it was your child
  - Protect it from bad code
  - Manage tech debt
- Broken Window Theory

## Other soft skills
- Learn how to ask for help when you need it
- Self-motivated - this might belong somewhere else
- Confidence - this likely comes with all the rest, but it's good to have independently as well
- Don't be a jerk
  - Don't be condescending
  - Don't use jargon to make others feel stupid or make yourself feel smart
  - Be patient with junior engineers whenever possible (sometimes deadlines prevent this)
  - Respect others' time
  - Language barriers
